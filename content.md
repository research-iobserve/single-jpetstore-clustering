  Contains the detail analysis output for each comparison of an ideal
  behavior model and a clustered behavior model.
- data
  The used Kieker logs.

  contains all ideal behavior models.
- pcm
  contains a PCM model (which was not used in our experiment).
- results
  contains the analysis results for EM and X-means, which are then
